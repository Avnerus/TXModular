The TX Modular System - Adding TX Classes to SuperCollider  3

The TX Modular system uses various classes which SuperCollider needs to know about in order to run the system.

To add these, copy the supplied folder TX Mod Extensions (or an alias of it) your Extensions folder (see SC help file Using Extensions for more details).

If you have an older TX Modular Extensions folder there then remove it first.

You also need to add the following to your Extensions folder:
-  sc3-plugins folder, which comes as an extra download with SC3
-  latest version of the wslib SuperCollider Quark (see Quarks help if required)

Note: If SuperCollider was already open before adding the extensions, you'll need to recompile the SuperCollider library (or if you prefer, quit and restart SuperCollider).
